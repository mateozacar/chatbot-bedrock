Overview
This document serves as a comprehensive guide for our Chatbot project, which utilizes advanced AI techniques to provide dynamic, context-aware interactions with users. The chatbot maintains session histories and is capable of understanding and responding to queries in a conversationally relevant manner.

#Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language.
langchain: LangChain is a framework to build with LLMs by chaining interoperable components. LangGraph is the framework for building controllable agentic workflows.
Streamlit: For building the web app frontend.
RunnableWithMessageHistory: A custom Python class designed to manage chat histories.
Bedrock AI: Provides the AI model running backend.


#Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python (3.12) and pip installed on your machine.

Getting Started
Clone the Repository: Clone the project to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:

bash


git clone https://your-repository-url.com/path/to/repo.git
cd repo-directory
Install Dependencies: Use pip to install the necessary Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configurations
Environment Setup: Define necessary environment variables, such as API keys or service endpoints:

bash

export API_KEY="your-api-key"
Modify Configuration Files: Adjust settings in config.py or similar files to reflect your operational parameters like database credentials and API endpoints.

Running the Application
To start the chatbot interface:

bash


streamlit run app.py
Access the interface by visiting http://localhost:8501 in your browser. Here you can interact directly with the chatbot through a user-friendly UI.

Example Usage
You can initiate a conversation by entering a question or a statement in the provided input field. The chatbot, powered by the configured AI model and history management, will respond contextually based on previous interactions and its AI understanding.

Maintenance and Logs
Keep the chatbot system updated and check logs regularly to ensure optimal operation:

Update Python and other dependencies to their latest secure versions.
Monitor logs for unexpected errors or security issues and address them promptly.
Conclusion
This guide provides detailed instructions and explanations for setting up, running, and maintaining the chatbot. It is designed to facilitate a smooth deployment and operation of the chatbot, ensuring a robust user interaction experience.
